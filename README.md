# codeAlpha_sniffer
This Python-based packet sniffer uses the Scapy library to capture and analyze live network traffic. It listens on a chosen network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi) and displays source IP, destination IP, and protocol number. By default, it captures 10 packets, making it ideal for learning packet inspection basics.
